## Notes

In the houses i found the blacksmith and gloves
In the cottage i found noyhing, also nothing on the rooms there
In the greenhouse of the garden i found a clue that told me to go to the meeting rooms on the town hall offices 

Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
